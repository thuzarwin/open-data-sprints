Project Scope and Charter
==============================================


Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

Increased transparency, public collaboration, and data-driven decision making are key goals of Austin's Open Data Initiative. In pursuit of these goals, City Departments developed open data plans and inventories during previous sprints. Currently, the format and quality of both products vary widely across departments. 

**Why it matters:**

.. 1-2 sentences. Why should we address this? What value would be gained by solving this problem now?

At the City level, a baseline measure of quality is needed to understand the City's open data strengths and opportunities. Having this information would help create a strategy for improving the City's open data offerings, track our progress, and recognize when the strategy is working well. 

At the Department level, [... insert language to address Stefan's `suggestion <https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-plans/issues/9>`_.]

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this probject will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

This project involves three main activities. First, we will generate a minimal-style open data plan for each department which will become the foundation for enhanced plan documents in future sprints. Second, we will use a selection of the City's existing performance indicators to create deliverables for a new data assessment project. Third, we will deploy the assessment project and create a public website to display our progress.
