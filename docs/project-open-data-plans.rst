The purpose of this document is to describe a project facilitated by the City of Austin's Open Data Initiative. It contains key contact information, the project scope and charter -- which identifies the problem statement, key partners, documents, and success criteria -- and links to working documents. Throughout the project, progress and final reports will be appended to provide a comprehensive account of the work and value delivered.

Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

Increased transparency, public collaboration, and data-driven decision making are key goals of Austin's Open Data Initiative. As part of the initiative's effort to pursue these goals, City Departments  developed open data inventories last year -- however, the information was often inconsistent, incomplete, or hard to understand. Furthermore, the inventory did not include information about how a department's data assets relate (if at all) to Austin's Key Performance Indicators. More information about department-level data is needed to understand the City's open data strengths and opportunities.

**Why it matters:**

.. 1-2 sentences. Why should we address this? What value would be gained by solving this problem now?

When we have more consistent inventories, information about each department's open data resources will be easier to discover and use. When departments have this information, they can work more strategically to  maintain their performance data. From the perspective of city performance, having more organized information about data sources would help the Performance Office assess measure reliability and improve how indicators are reported.

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this probject will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

This project involves three main activities. First, we will develop a working list of questions we'd like to be able to answer about each department's open data assets. Second, we will design and deploy a survey to collect the information needed to answer those questions. Third, we will publish our progress and findings publicly so anyone interested can access the results and create their own analyses.

Success criteria
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: When will we know we've successfully completed this project? Add brief, specific criteria here. Mention specific deliverables if needed.

We'll know this project has been successfully completed when:

- We can measure how many of the City's Key Performance Indicators can be sourced from raw, structured data
- We have published our findings publicly and in dataset format 
- We have completed our project deliverables, including progress and final reports

Deliverables

Scope Amendments
----------------------------------------------

**Sep 23, 2016:**  

The scope is being modified to focus more on the KPI Data Assessment activity. Integration of the assessment results into the open data plans documents will be postponed to a later sprint, likely as part of a broader open data plans improvement project. 

Summary of changes:

- modified problem statement to exclude plan-focused activities
- in success criteria, replaced publishing open data plans with publishing the KPI data assessment findings
- removed plan-related items from deliverables
- change project title from Open Data Plans Reboot to KPI Data Assessment
