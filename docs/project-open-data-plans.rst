.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: Replace the [placeholder text] with the name of your project.

The purpose of this document is to describe a project facilitated by the City of Austin's Open Data Initiative. It contains key contact information, the project scope and charter -- which identifies the problem statement, key partners, documents, and success criteria -- and links to working documents. Throughout the project, progress and final reports will be appended to provide a comprehensive account of the work and value delivered.

Project Scope and Charter
==============================================


Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

Increased transparency, public collaboration, and data-driven decision making are key goals of Austin's Open Data Initiative. When fully realized this (City-wide project)[unclear which project we're talking about] will benefit both the community as well as City government to become more efficient and effective. City Departments have developed open data plans and inventories during previous sprints, however they are not all consistent, complete, or published in central location. Furthermore, there is little documentation available about how our data assets relate to City's Key Performance Indicators. [needs tuning]

**Why it matters:**

.. 1-2 sentences. Why should we address this? What value would be gained by solving this problem now?

At the City level, a baseline measure of quality is needed to understand the City's open data strengths and opportunities. Having this information would help create a strategy for improving the City's open data offerings, track our progress, and recognize when the strategy is working well. When departments have this information, they will be better equipped to discover opportunities to combine efforts and save time when reporting KPIs to the budget office.[pick a better example] From the Performance perspective, this information would help the Performance Office assess measure reliability and inform future work to automate indicator reporting processes.  

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this probject will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

This project involves three main activities. First, we will generate a minimal-style open data plan for each department which will become the foundation for enhanced plan documents in future sprints. Second, we will use a selection of the City's existing performance indicators to create deliverables for a new data assessment project. Third, we will deploy the assessment project and create a public website to display our progress.
