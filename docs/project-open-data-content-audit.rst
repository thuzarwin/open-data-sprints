Project Description Document
==============================================

The purpose of this document is to describe a project by the Open Data Initiative. It explains the reason for the project and identifies key partners, documents, and succes criteria. Throughout the project period, progress reports and final reports may be added to the bottom of this document, so as to deliver a complete account of the project work performed from start to finish. 


Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

Information about Austin's Open Data Initiative is published online but the content can be hard to find, hard to understand, or published repeatedly in muliple places. Currently, the initiative's core team does not have a list  of locations where official open data information is published online. This makes it difficult for the core team to ensure official information about Austin's Open Data Initiative is accessible, accurate, and up to date.   

**Why it matters:**

The City's Open Data Initiative attracts attention from all kinds of people and interests -- members of the general public, City staff, community organizations, businesses, media, other government agencies, academia, and more -- and it is important each be able to find useful, reliable information about the intiative. The core team needs a better understanding of where official open data information lives so it can allocate resources and do the work needed to deliver that information in a way that's both efficient and effective.

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this probject will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

This project will develop an inventory of items currently published online about Austin's Open Data Intitiative. The inventory will be analyzed to describe content locations, types, and owners. A brief literature review will identify examples and best practices for managing organizational web content, then a gap analysis will be performed to reveal differences between the literature findings and the inventory findings. A final memo will deliver options for changing how open data web content is managed and include recommendations for next steps.
