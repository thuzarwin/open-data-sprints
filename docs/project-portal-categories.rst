Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

The existing categories do not represent accurate grouping of datasets on the City of Austin Open Data Portal.
Customers are unable to browse for similar datasets organized by specific interest, which hinders the ability to discover unknown datasets.
There are no guidelines for open data publishers to determine the best categories for classifying datasets.

**Why it matters:**

.. 1-2 sentences. Why should we address this? What value would be gained by solving this problem now?

Better category options will improve organized grouping of similar datasets to increase ease of use and comprehension.
Customers will be able to browse datasets by categories to improve discoverability.
Better consistency and guidelines will make it easier for publishing data.

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this probject will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.
