Project Scope and Charter
==============================================

Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

The City of Austin Open Data Liaisons and staff who work with formal public information requests (PIRs) should connect the demand expressed in PIRs to the proactive disclosure of open data. However, the degrees to which the open data portal is currently and could potentially be utilized to satisfy public information requests (PIRs) is currently unknown. Furthermore, data from the PIR system to 1) describe trends, 2) uncover gaps and overlaps with the open data portal, and 3) help the open data team recommend effective and efficient provisioning is not accessible.

**Why it matters:**

.. 1-2 sentences. Why should we address this? What value would be gained by solving this problem now?

-The increased supply of proactively published government data and information on the open data portal should decrease the need for formal PIRs and the accompanying processes. This should reduce the considerable time and cost committed by the City, while improving the customer experience in terms of accessibility, transparency, and self-service.

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this project will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

In order to determine the return on effort for this initiative, we plan to:
1. Understand the audiences (internal and external)
2. Identify current obstacles (internal and external)
3. Analyze current PIR data to prioritize proactive discloser
