Project Scope and Charter
==============================================


Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------

.. AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS: This section briefly describes the problem, explains why it matters, and introduces the solution. Fill in the placeholder text below.

**About the problem:**

.. 2-3 sentences. What are the basic facts of the problem?

The City does not have documented core user needs and accompanying guidelines for assessing open data products.

**Why it matters:**

As the City of Austin's Open Data Initiative has evolved, the current product offerings have limitations or lack features sufficient for our growing needs.  As the market matures, there are new tools and solutions that may provide value to the initiative.  By creating requirements, we can create an objective and repeatable evaluation process.

**The approach:**

.. 2-3 sentences. Describe what this project will do and how it will deliver value back to the City and the Open Data Initiative. Keep it brief here -- specific deliverables will be added in the next section.

- Explore ways to access and use the evaluation criteria/tool
