Project Scope and Charter
==============================================


Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------
The City of Austin's Open Data Portal provides easy access to open data and information about the city's government to encourage the use of public information which the Open Data Liaisons and Open Data City Employees Enthusiasts have published to spark innovation, promote public collaboration, increase government transparency, and inform decision making. With the absence and lack of updated City of Austin’s training materials and resources, Open Data Liaisons and Open Data City Employees Enthusiasts are experiencing a wide range of knowledge gaps when it comes to Socarata’s software. As a result, many are experiencing road blocks as they perform their necessary tasks and are turning to other tools to help them achieve their goals. Meanwhile public users are visiting the portal and are greeted with outdated training materials, leaving them unclear on how to use the portal.


**Why it matters:**

The purpose of this project sprint is to update training materials and provide open data training resources needed for the various levels of knowledge and skill existing amongst city staff and public users. Equipping Open Data Liaisons, Open Data City Employees Enthusiasts and public users with the necessary tools will enable and empower them to further meet their goals and contribute to the city’s Open Data Initiative.


**The approach:**

We will use IBM Design Thinking Field Guide as guiding post throughout our project to define and understand the problem, observe and research users, analyze and identify users’ training and knowledge needs, strategize ways to fill training need gaps, develop training materials, and validate training materials with users and stakeholders. We will also work with Socrata's Education team to develop two virtual custom courses.
