# Open Data Sprint Documents

## about this repo

This repo contains documents that define the projects we work on during Open Data Initiative sprints. In addition to storing these docs, this repo stores the content and configuration files needed to publish them to a searchable public website (http://sprints.opendata.rocks). 

## how publishing works (for developers)

Open data sprint documents are written in reStructured text markup and converted to HTML by a documentation generator called [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html).

The HTML generated by Sphinx is hosted by [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/). Readthedocs.org watches the `master` branch of this repo. When changes are detected, readthedocs.org will re-build the sprint docs using Sphinx and publish the updated site to http://open-data-sprints.rtfd.org.
